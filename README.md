# First-Come-First-Served_Process-Scheduling_OS
This C program implements the FCFS algorithm. It takes the number of processes, arrival time, and burst time as input from the user. It calculates the waiting time and turn around time for each process and displays them along with average waiting time and turn around time. The program is implemented using arrays and loops.
